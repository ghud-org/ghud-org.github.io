      <h1>The hidden cost of calendar events</h1>

      <p>
        Most calendar events don’t just cost time — they cost money too. And
        when we track those in separate places, we create hidden costs.
      </p>

      <p>Here are some important tasks for nearly everyone:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Budget time</li>
        <li>Budget money</li>
        <li>Live life</li>
        <li>Adjust budgets</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        Life is a lot -- a lot of the time. Some people forget step 3 because
        they're stuck on 1 and 2. Some people can't get to step 4 because,
        well... it's a lot.
      </p>

      <p>
        This means that most of our budgeting <em>goes to waste</em> in the
        deceptively large gap between our calendar (time budget) and our
        checkbook (money budget). If our hands are occupied juggling all that
        life itself brings, how can we add these two items into the mix? Grow a
        third hand and juggle the two with it?
      </p>

      <h2>What we can do about it</h2>

      <p>
        It's simple. ...I mean, literally that -- keep it simple. We've all
        heard that advice. Most budgets are simple anyway because it's intuitive
        to do so. But there's a deeper level of simplicity that is often
        overlooked --
        <strong>repeatability</strong>.
      </p>

      <h2>Why repeatability alleviates the hidden cost</h2>

      <p>
        If life is a lot, it's probably chaotic. But <em>patterns</em> emerge
        nonetheless. When we observe these patterns, very different from
        <em>enforcing</em>, we can build <strong>routines</strong>. And with
        these routines, we can build 'muscle memory'. Thus, building routines
        into our simple (but useful) budgets makes them a much lighter load to
        carry.
      </p>

      <p>
        Think about it -- the most expensive part of budgeting is
        <em>adjusting</em>. Why is it the most expensive? Because there's
        usually not enough resources (time/money) available in the day to get to
        it <em>accurately</em>. Why is it hard to do this accurately? Because
        the budgets live in two different places with little or no integration
        whatsoever.
      </p>

      <p>
        When our budgets ignore this overlap, we increase the gap between our
        budgets, and we pay with missed opportunities, wasted planning,
        mismanaged money, and unnecessary stress. That’s the hidden cost.
