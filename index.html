      <p>
        At Ghud, we believe productivity is <strong>holistic</strong> —
        balancing family, work, and simplicity — and that well-designed software
        should reflect that philosophy. Our projects aim to help people spend
        less time fighting tools and more time doing what matters.
      </p>

      <h2>🌱 Philosophy &amp; Focus</h2>

          you manage time, energy, and priorities with clarity.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Simplicity First:</strong> Minimal, maintainable designs that
          reduce friction for users and developers alike.
        </li>
