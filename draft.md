# The hidden cost of calendar events

Here are some important tasks for nearly everyone:

1. Budget time
2. Budget money
3. Live life
4. Adjust budgets

Life is a lot -- a lot of the time.
Some people forget step 3 because they're stuck on 1 and 2.
Some people can't get to step 4 because, well... it's a lot.

This means that most of our budgeting _goes to waste_ in the deceptively large gap between our calendar (time budget) and our checkbook (money budget). If our hands are occupied juggling all that life itself brings, how can we add these two items into the mix? Grow a third hand and juggle the two with it?

## What we can do about it

It's simple.
...I mean, literally that -- keep it simple.
We've all heard that advice.
Most budgets are simple anyway because it's intuitive to do so.
But there's a deeper level of simplicity that is often overlooked -- **repeatability**.

## Why repeatability alleviates the hidden cost

If life is a lot, it's probably chaotic.
But _patterns_ emerge nonetheless.
When we observe these patterns, very different from _enforcing_, we can build **routines**.
And with these routines, we can build 'muscle memory'.
Thus, building routines into our simple (but useful) budgets becomes natural and a much lighter load to carry.
