# Ghud 🕰️

**Building software that simplifies life, supports focus, and scales with people.**

At Ghud, we believe productivity is **holistic** — balancing family, work, and simplicity — and that well-designed software should reflect that philosophy. Our projects aim to help people spend less time fighting tools and more time doing what matters.

## 🌱 Philosophy & Focus

- **Holistic Productivity:** Tools and concepts that help you manage time, energy, and priorities with clarity.
- **Simplicity First:** Minimal, maintainable designs that reduce friction for users and developers alike.
- **Thought Leadership:** Essays, articles, and blog posts sharing insights on engineering, personal productivity, and organizational design.
- **Software Principles:** Core concepts that guide how we design software — scalable, maintainable, user-first, and purposeful.

## 🚀 Active Project: Tandm

**Tandm** (Time and Money) is our flagship calendar app that **integrates financial awareness directly into your schedule**.

- Designed to help users **plan their time and budget simultaneously** in a single tool, making it easier to adapt to life’s unpredictability.
- Solves a common pain point: managing time and money in separate places while most events have associated costs.
- Ideal for anyone who wants to **manage events, expenses, and priorities all in one place**.
