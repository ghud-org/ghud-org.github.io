Our mission is to empower developers by providing foundational libraries, utilities, and applications that embrace clarity, simplicity, and composabilityâ€”rooted in the Elegant Objects approach to object-oriented programming and clean design philosophies.

At Ghud, we believe software should feel intuitive and intentional, fostering a natural flow in development and user experience.

## Ghud Ecosystem Naming Guide

At Ghud, we embrace **modularity and loose coupling** not only in our software design but also in our product naming. Every product in the Ghud ecosystem uniquely implements a **single category** or **function**, similar to how a class implements an interface.

---

### Naming Pattern

- Each product has a **unique, descriptive name** reflecting its purpose.
- Each product explicitly declares the **category it implements** via a simple namespace-style prefix:
    - ghud \[category\]: \[product-name\]

### Examples

| Category | Product Name | Full Name Example        | Description                              |
| -------- | ------------ | ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| OOP      | elegant-js   | ghud oop: elegant-js     | An Elegant Objects inspired JS library   |
| SSG      | fengsh-ui    | ghud ssg: fengsh-ui      | HTML-first zero-JS static site generator |
| Website  | garden-eng   | ghud website: garden-eng | Ghud's digital garden.                   |

### Benefits

- **Loose coupling:** Categories are interfaces; implementations can swap easily.
- **Clear contracts:** Users instantly know what a product _does_ and its role.
- **Creative freedom:** Products keep unique names that resonate with their vision.
- **Scalability:** Easily add new categories or implementations without naming conflicts.
